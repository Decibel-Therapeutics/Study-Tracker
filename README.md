## Building and running locally

1. Make sure you have all requirements installed.
2. Create a new MongoDB database and user account.
3. If you plan on doing local development or running tests, perform the following steps:
   3a. Create a test database and user account. 3b. Add a `test.properties` file in
   the `src/test/resources` folder of each module of the project. Use the
   provided `test.properties.example` file as a template for filling in the required information.
4. Create a new file, `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Use the
   `application.properties.example` file as a template for filling out the required parameters for
   running the application.
5. Build the application in the following order:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    ```

6. You can run the application with Maven:

    ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run 
   ```
   
   Or, you can execute the packaged WAR file directly:
   
   ```bash
   java -jar study-tracker.war
   ```
