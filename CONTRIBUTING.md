## Reporting Bugs

If you have found a bug in Study Tracker, please take the following steps to report it:

1. **Search the Issues page for an existing ticket**. It is quite possible you are not the first person to experience this issue, so be sure to see if a ticket exists for the issue already. 
2. **The squeeky wheel gets the oil.** If a ticket for your bug does exist, leave a comment describing your experience with the issue. The more reports confirming the bug, the more likely it is to get immediate attention.
3. **Create a new issue ticket.** If there is no existing issue for the bug, create a new one. Be sure to describe the issue in as much detail as possible, providing screenshots, log output, and *de-identified* configuration properties where possible.
4. **Follow-up after a patch is provided.** After the issue is resolved, leave a comment on your issue to inform us whether the bug was truly resolved or not. It is hard to know if we fixed your problem if we never hear back from you!

## Merge Requests

Code contributions are always welcome, but should follow the guidelines described below:

1. **Create an issue.** All merge requests should have an accompanying ticket logged in the Issues page. If one does not already exist for your request, create one.
2. **Name your branches accordingly.** Branches should be named using the issue ID and a short summary. For example, if I was going to merge a fix for a React dependency upgrade, I might name my branch `123-react-upgrade`. 
3. **Test your code.** All merge requests will run through several series of tests before being merged (both public and private). Be sure to test your code to ensure that your merge request will be accepted. 
4. **Follow the style guide.** Study Tracker follows the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for Java and JavaScript. Plugins are available for most IDEs to ensure that all committed code follows the requested style.
